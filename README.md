![Jev Auto in the Claude Code model picker](docs/model-picker.png)

Automatic model routing for Claude Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, and OpenAI Codex.
Each turn goes to the cheapest model that can actually handle it, with the decision made by
[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai), TypeSafe's System One decision model.

`jev-claude` runs the real Claude Code CLI. The interface, keybindings, tools, permission prompts,
`/compact`, `/resume` and session handling are unchanged, because they are still Claude
Code's.

`jev-opencode`, `jev-codex`, and `jev-copilot` likewise launch their native CLIs. Copilot keeps
its complete terminal interface, tools, sessions, extensions, and logged-in GitHub
authentication.

## Quick start

Requires [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup) and Node.js 20.12+.

```bash
npm install -g jev-router
echo "JEV_API_KEY=..." > ~/.jev-claude.env
jev-claude
```

Get a key from [TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai) for free. The package is `jev-router`;
the command it installs is `jev-claude`. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is needed:
`jev-claude` reuses your existing `claude login`, so a Claude Pro or Max subscription works
as-is. Without a Jev key you simply get plain Claude Code.

Every argument is forwarded to `claude`, so `jev-claude -p "..."`, `jev-claude --resume` and
the rest behave exactly as you expect.

Copilot needs only the Jev key and your existing `copilot` login:

```bash
jev-copilot
jev-copilot -p "fix the typo in src/app.ts"
```

No OpenAI key or BYOK configuration is used. Running `jev-copilot` means **Jev Auto** is on;
run plain `copilot` for manual/native model selection. Every Copilot CLI argument is forwarded.

OpenCode and Codex currently use an OpenAI-compatible provider, so add that provider's key:

```bash
cat > ~/.jev-router.env <<'EOF'
JEV_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
EOF
jev-opencode
jev-codex
```

The wrappers use temporary, process-local provider overrides; they do not rewrite your
OpenCode or Codex configuration. Those clients can bypass routing by explicitly selecting
another model.

## Using it

Sessions start on a **Jev Auto** entry added to the `/model` picker
([pictured above](docs/model-picker.png)). While it is selected,
every turn is routed. Pick any other model and routing stands down entirely: your choice goes
to the API untouched and Jev is not consulted. Reselect Jev Auto to resume routing
mid-session.

A status line shows which mode you are in and what the last turn actually used:

```
⚡ haiku p=0.98 · my-project · 8% context        routed, Jev confidence 0.98
⏸ manual Opus 4.6 · my-project · 21% context     your own choice
```

This matters because Claude Code's own UI reports the model it *requested*, not the one the
proxy routed to. It has no way to know the request was rewritten.

The status line is installed with `--settings`, which merges rather than replaces. If you
already have a `statusLine` configured, yours is kept and nothing is injected. Set
`JEV_NO_STATUSLINE=1` to disable it.

> Choosing any row with `Enter` makes Claude Code save it as your default for new sessions.
> `jev-claude` restores your previous default on exit, so a saved `jev-auto` can never break
> plain `claude`. Press `s` instead to switch for the current session only.

## How it works

`jev-claude` starts a proxy on a loopback port and launches the real `claude` with
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointing at it. Claude Code sends its normal requests; the proxy
rewrites one field and forwards everything upstream.

```
you -> claude (real CLI, real UI) -> jev-claude proxy -> api.anthropic.com
                                            |
                                            +-> Jev: which tier does this turn need?
```

Claude Code does not validate model names behind a custom base URL, so the `jev-auto`
sentinel reaches the proxy as an exact "route this turn" signal rather than something to
infer.

Your Claude credentials are never read, stored or modified. The proxy forwards the
`authorization` header it receives without inspecting it.

Copilot has no equivalent base-URL override for GitHub-hosted inference. `jev-copilot`
therefore starts a loopback HTTPS CONNECT proxy and launches the stock CLI with a temporary
`HTTPS_PROXY`. A one-day certificate authority is generated for that process and supplied
through `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; it is never installed in the Windows trust store.

Only `api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com` and `api.githubcopilot.com` are decrypted. Other
connections are tunneled unchanged. The proxy changes the request body's `model` field and
forwards the original URL, authentication headers, and response stream to GitHub:

```
you -> stock Copilot CLI -> jev-copilot HTTPS proxy -> GitHub-hosted Copilot
                                  |
                                  +-> Jev: which tier?
```

This is deliberately not Copilot BYOK: `COPILOT_PROVIDER_*` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are not
required. WebSocket Responses are disabled for the child process so the proxy only has to
handle ordinary HTTP and SSE traffic.

## Routing rules

One Jev call per user turn selects a tier. `src/policy.mjs` then applies, in order:

- an explicit `use opus` in your message wins outright;
- a Jev failure, timeout or unrecognised answer keeps the current model;
- a low-confidence answer never downgrades, and caps upgrades at Sonnet;
- a downgrade is refused once the conversation is large, since switching models invalidates
  the prompt cache and the rebuild costs more than the downgrade saves;
- the tier is clamped to what is enabled, stepping up rather than down, and never up into
  Fable, which bills extra usage credits.

Routing is fail-open by construction: every error path keeps the original model.

Three kinds of request are deliberately not routed:

| Request | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Any model other than `jev-auto` | You chose it. This also covers Claude Code's internal Haiku calls for titles and summaries. |
| Tool-loop continuations | A turn spans many requests. The tier is chosen once and pinned, so the model cannot change mid-task. |
| Calls carrying no tools | Auxiliary work, not a user turn. |

Sub-agents are routed, but pinned separately, so a sub-agent's choice cannot leak into the
main conversation.

## Configuration

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `JEV_API_KEY` | Required for routing. `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` also works. |
| `JEV_ALLOW_FABLE` | Set to `1` to let the router pick Fable, which bills extra usage credits. Off by default. |
| `JEV_NO_STATUSLINE` | Set to `1` to stop injecting the status line. |
| `JEV_DEBUG` | Logs every decision and rewrite. Interactive sessions write to `~/.jev-claude.log`, since stderr would corrupt Claude Code's UI; `-p` mode writes to stderr. |
| `JEV_DUMP` | Path prefix for dumping request bodies, for debugging wire-format changes. |
| `JEV_OPENAI_FAST_MODEL` | Cheapest OpenAI-family model, including hosted Copilot. Defaults to `gpt-5.6-luna`. |
| `JEV_OPENAI_BALANCED_MODEL` | Default OpenAI-family tier. Defaults to `gpt-5.6-terra`. |
| `JEV_OPENAI_STRONG_MODEL` | Strong OpenAI-family tier. Defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol`. |
| `JEV_OPENAI_LONG_MODEL` | Opt-in long-running tier. Defaults to `gpt-6-astra`. |
| `JEV_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Upstream OpenAI-compatible origin. Defaults to `https://api.openai.com`; useful for gateways and local testing. |

The new wrappers prefer existing environment variables, then a `.env` in the launch
directory, `~/.jev-router.env`, and finally the legacy `~/.jev-claude.env`.
`jev-claude` continues to support its existing environment-file behavior.

Tier definitions, the Jev question, confidence thresholds and timeouts all live in
`src/config.mjs`, which is the entire policy surface.

## Compatibility notes

Three things the proxy has to handle, none of them documented:

- **MCP tool schemas.** Claude Code normalises draft-04 JSON Schema relics before sending
  them first-party, but skips that step when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set. An MCP server
  emitting `"exclusiveMinimum": true` would have the entire request rejected, so the proxy
  performs the conversion itself.
- **Model capabilities.** Claude Code composes each body for the model it believes it is
  using. Routing down to Haiku while leaving `thinking`, `output_config.effort` or a
  `clear_thinking` context-management strategy in place is a hard 400, so those fields are
  stripped for tiers that do not support them.
- **`HEAD /`.** Claude Code probes the base URL before its first request.

## Development

```bash
npm install
echo "JEV_API_KEY=..." > .env

npm test                     # 56 offline tests
node test/live-routing.mjs   # real Jev calls across four difficulty tiers
node test/e2e-copilot.mjs    # real Jev + logged-in GitHub-hosted Copilot inference
node bin/jev-claude.mjs -p "what is 2+2?"

npm link                     # try the globally installed form
```

`npm test` covers the policy decision table with synthetic Jev answers, plus the proxy's pure
functions: schema sanitising, turn detection, capability stripping, conversation keying and
settings restoration.

The wording of the Jev question matters more than expected. Instructing Jev to judge the
reasoning a request demands rather than the length of the reply it asks for moved a hard
debugging prompt ending in "answer in one sentence" from 0.21 confidence on Haiku to 0.81 on
Opus.

## Limitations

- Your prompt text is sent to TypeSafe for the routing decision. Nothing else is.
- Jev adds roughly 300 ms to the first request of a turn, and about a second on the first
  call of a session while TLS is established. Tool-loop requests add nothing.
- Claude Code's request format is not a public contract. If a future version moves things
  around, `JEV_DUMP` is how you find out.
- OpenCode and Codex currently route OpenAI Responses or Chat Completions traffic to
  `api.openai.com`; provider-specific protocols are not translated.
- Copilot routing uses process-scoped TLS interception. The proxy necessarily sees Copilot
  prompts and bearer tokens in memory while forwarding them, but never logs or stores them.
  Its temporary certificate and private key are deleted when the wrapper exits.
- While `jev-copilot` is running, Jev routing overrides Copilot's `/model` selection. Exit and
  run plain `copilot` when you want manual or Copilot-native model routing.
- Chaining through an existing corporate `HTTPS_PROXY` is not currently supported.
- Developed and tested on Windows against Claude Code v2.1.101.
